# Udacity Frontend Nanodegree Resume Project

First I wrote this project using helper functions and jquery for the nanodegree project.

Recently I refactored it using React, and I use webpack to bundle it. For a single resume it might seem an overkill, but this could easily be turned into an app as the app builds the web page from a single json file.

- React.js
- Babel
- Postcss
- CssNext (CssNext is deprecated, but I chose to leave it here as it still works. The project does not make use of the new css functionality, except the css variables. I just wanted to see how to implement it at a project. With my new projects I use postcss-preset-env.)
- Webpack
