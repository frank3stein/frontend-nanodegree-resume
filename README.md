# Udacity Frontend Nanodegree Resume Project
First I wrote this project using helper functions and jquery for the nanodegree project. Recently I refractored it using React. For a single resume it might seem an overkill, but this could easily be turned into an app as depending on a structured json, this app can create the whole page.
